## Transparent Pixel Response

This package provides a modified Response class, which returns the image in GIF format of size 1 by 1 pixel. Frequently this image is used when registering openings of e-mail messages.

I used the example from article [Transparent pixel response with Symfony, how to track email opening](http://loige.co/transparent-pixel-response-with-symfony-how-to-track-email-opening/).
